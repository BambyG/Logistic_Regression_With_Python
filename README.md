# Logistic Regression With Python - Titanic

This analysis is based on a Kaggle [dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic) about Titanic sinking tragedy.
The objective is to come up with a model to predict whether an individual is more likely to survive or not.
This project will be divided into 2 main parts:
- Get an overview of the data, by cleaning the data and exploring it (EDA).
- Predicting if an individual was more likely to survive on factors such as its class, title, sex, age using the Logistic Regression Model.

To achieve this goal I am using Python programming language and libraries such as Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit.
Please open the **Logistic Regression With Python - Titanic.ipynb** to see the project.
